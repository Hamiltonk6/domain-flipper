# Domain Flipper (Quick Start)

Password-protected, dark-mode site that shows hot niches and auto-generates domain ideas (.com / .co.uk).

- Password: `flip2025`
- Phase 1: static data (this repo)
- Phase 2: optional live scraping backend

## Deploy (Phase 1)
1. Upload all files to a GitHub repo.
2. Go to https://vercel.com → New Project → Import your repo → Deploy.
3. Open your Vercel URL → log in with `flip2025`.

## Upgrade to live scraping (Phase 2)
Add a small Node backend (Render/Railway) and point `script.js` to it. I’ll provide the steps separately.
